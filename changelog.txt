	- Push Notification Enabled
Now You can get push notification from both our github site and our android app. 
You don't have to do anything in the app. 
But for subscribing to our web notification, all you have to do is open this site: 
https://aacs-allaboutcybersecurity.github.io/
and wait for some time. After some time you'll be prompted to allow notification. Click allow.

That's all
We will start sending you notification about new update. You'll be the first to get it.
